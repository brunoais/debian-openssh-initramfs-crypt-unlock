# Configuration options for the openssh-initramfs-crypt-unlock boot scripts.
# You must run update-initramfs(8) to effect changes to this file (like
# for other files under the '/etc/openssh-initramfs-crypt-unlock' directory).

# Whether to copy configuration from sshd
# This option is only useful to safeguard against adding sshd configuration files and having them ending up on
# /etc/ssh/ directory by mistake.
# You'll need to add relevant configuration instead. You can use this command as a start:
# cp -pn /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/* /etc/openssh-initramfs-crypt-unlock/sshd_config.d/
# Set to 'n' to disable
COPY_SSHD_CONFIG=y

# On local (non-NFS) mounts, interfaces matching this pattern are
# brought down before exiting the ramdisk to avoid dirty network
# configuration in the normal kernel.
# The special value 'none' keeps all interfaces up and preserves routing
# tables and addresses.
## Stop all internet in initramfs when mounting root (default)
# shellcheck disable=SC2125
export IFDOWN=*
# Keep all internet interfaces when booting to linux
# export IFDOWN=none
